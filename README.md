## Hi there 👋

**Dan0pal/Dan0pal** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi! I'm currently studying Computer Science at Tecnológico de Monterrey. I'm passionate about software development, data analysis, and specially game development.

Right now, I'm working on a sports performance project, where I collect physical data from athletes and develop a dashboard to help coaches make better decisions. It's my first hands-on experience in real-world project development, and it's been both challenging and exciting.

I also enjoy working on object-oriented programming, especially in C++, and I'm always looking to improve my skills in Python, data visualization, and game development with Unity. One of my personal goals is to build a Dungeons & Dragons companion app to help manage my campaigns more easily.

I'm always open to collaboration, learning from others, and sharing what I know. Feel free to check out my repositories!
